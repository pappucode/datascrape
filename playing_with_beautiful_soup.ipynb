      "         Hey everyone. I wanted to give you an update on my videos. I will be releasing videos on threading and multiprocessing within the next week. Thanks so much for your patience. I currently have a temporary recording studio setup at my Airbnb that will allow me to record and edit the threading/multiprocessing videos. I am going to be moving into my new house in 10 days and once I have my recording studio setup then you can expect much faster video releases. I really appreciate how patient everyone has been while I go through this move, especially those of you who are contributing monthly through YouTube\n",

      "         In this Python Programming Tutorial, we will be learning how to set up a Python development environment in VSCode on MacOS. VSCode is a very nice free editor for writing Python applications and many developers are now switching over to this editor. In this video, we will learn how to install VSCode, get the Python extension installed, how to change Python interpreters, create virtual environments, format/lint our code, how to use Git within VSCode, how to debug our programs, how unit testing works, and more. We have a lot to cover, so let’s go ahead and get started…\n",
